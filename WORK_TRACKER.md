# Work tracker

Updated: 2026-10-06. Track: Small Specialist. Research runs: none.

| ID | Work | Status | Completion evidence / next gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EAI-001 | Local Git and GitHub origin | DONE | main; mks-hash/efficient-agentic-inference |
| EAI-002 | Local planning sources | DONE | Two original files preserved in ignored .develop/ |
| EAI-003 | Bootstrap docs, ADR, schema, benchmark contract | DONE | Initial bootstrap commit a3a7157; versioned schemas validated by runner/tests |
| EAI-004 | CPU lexical runner and synthetic contract fixture | DONE | 14 contract tests, ruff lint/format and locked sync pass; CLI fixture complete |
| EAI-005 | SWE-bench acquisition/reconstruction + patch labeler | IN_PROGRESS | Pinned 12-task dev pilot prepared; 30 tests and local leakage audit pass; clean-code evidence run pending |
| EAI-006 | Frozen full-corpus lexical baseline + candidate ceiling | IN_PROGRESS | Initial 12-task isolated pilot measured; final report/provenance pending |
| EAI-007 | Untuned small/generalist matrix | TODO | Verify primary model sources; freeze config and authorize resources |
| EAI-008 | Training decision | BLOCKED_BY_EAI-007 | Material gap, preregistered targets and authorized budget |
| EAI-009 | Public README positioning and documentation separation | DONE | Research narrative and CPS formula in README; scope/candidates in plan, implementation/check details in reproduction guide |
| EAI-010 | Independent second-host reproduction | NOT_RUN | Same-host fresh-directory rebuild and isolated predict established; separate host confirmation remains |

## Open decisions before model evaluation

- Exact model revisions, licenses/access and resource fit.
- Train/validation memberships and broader repository/time controls; dev/final pilot IDs are frozen.
- SS-H2 margin and SS-H3 quality, fallback and economic targets.
- Hardware/backend/pricing boundary and approved GPU budget.

No models have passed evidence gates. Synthetic/local verification must not
promote any model gate or research hypothesis to PASS.

## Bootstrap verification

Local environment: Python 3.12.14 in the uv virtual environment. Locked dependency
sync, ruff checks, formatting and 14 unittest cases passed. `eai baseline --synthetic`
produced all three expected fixture records, including the unreachable new-file
label. Cost/CPS remain null. Artifacts live in ignored
`results/runs/bootstrap-fixture/`; no SWE-bench/model measurement was made.

This section records the historical v1 fixture check. The active contract is v2:
predict/evaluate are independent programs, and GitHub CPU CI includes Parquet
fixtures plus 30 contract tests on Python 3.11 and 3.14.

## SWE-bench foundation

Frozen dev-v1 selects 12 of 225 source tasks, two per each of six repositories,
without reading patches for selection. All Verified IDs are reserved. Snapshot
labels use solution patch only. Candidate policy and edge cases are frozen in ADR
0002 and localization-v2. No model evidence gates have changed.
